    <h1>ABOUT THE BAND</h1>
    <img src="../images/crowd.jpg" alt="Band">
    <p>Part Jimi Hendrix, part James Brown and all New Orleans, Dauphine’s Revival is a hard-edged funk band that employs brass-band beats, rock dynamics and improvisation in a jazz tradition. NPR hailed them as “New Orleans’ brightest new stars in a generation,” and New York Magazine wrote that “Dauphine’s Revival takes in a century- plus worth of sounds— ragtime and jazz and gospel and soul and R&B and hip-hop—and attacks everything they play with festive fervor.” </p>
